It's an AI-based app that simplifies understanding webpages, YouTube videos, and PDFs.

It's a basic prototype app designed for analyzing personal documents (in PDF format), webpage content, or YouTube videos. Users can simply ask questions about the content, and the app will provide answers sourced specifically from their personal data. It won't respond if the question is unrelated to the content source.

 #Usage
To simplify investment analysis using newspaper articles, brokers can input webpage URLs into QuerAI and ask specific questions. For instance, if they're considering investing in automobiles, they can inquire if the article covers this topic and request a summary if relevant.
