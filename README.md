# QuerAI
It's an AI-based app that simplifies understanding webpages, YouTube videos, and PDFs.

## Introduction
It's a basic prototype app designed for analyzing personal documents (in PDF format), webpage content, or YouTube videos. Users can simply ask questions about the content, and the app will provide answers sourced specifically from their personal data. It won't respond if the question is unrelated to the content source.

2.For a dedicated learner, YouTube videos serve as an excellent source of knowledge, and QuerAI can significantly enhance their learning experience. By simply asking questions, learners can obtain answers from QuerAI about anything they wish to understand from the video.Here I have uploaded the link of a youtube video from think school channel.
